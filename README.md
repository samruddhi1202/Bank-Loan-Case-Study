# Bank-Loan-Case-Study
The main aim of this project is to identify patterns that indicate if a customer will have
difficulty paying their instalments. This information can be used to make decisions such as
denying the loan, reducing the amount of the loan, or lending at a higher interest rate to
risky applicants. The company wants to understand the key factors behind loan default to
make better decisions about loan approval.
